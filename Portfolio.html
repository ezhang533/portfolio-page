<h1>Emma Zhang</h1>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p1>My name is Emma Zhang. I was born on October 23, 2000 in
  Queens, NY where I spent my early school years before moving to
   Jericho, NY just before Middle School. While attending Jericho
    Senior High School, I developed an interest for the STEM
    fields, often filling my classes with science and math related
     classes such as AP Physics and Multivariable Calculus.
     Naturally, I also began learning about different aspects of engineering
     during classes that my school fortunately provided.
     This led to participate in the Girls Who Code program over
     the summer where I realized my passion for computer science
      and coding, further reinforcing my desire to work in the
       STEM fields. </p1>
